# 🕉️🔱 Project-Trinoyon

Welcome to **Project-Trinoyon** — a small initiative to make this Durga Puja truly a celebration for all! This project dedicated to bringing smiles to the lives of underprivileged people during Durga Puja.

In this project, we combine **donations**, **gaming**, and **community support** to raise funds that will be directly used to help street-dwelling individuals during the festive season.

## ❓Problem Statement
