Welcome to **Project-Trinoyon** — a heartfelt initiative to make Durga Puja a celebration for everyone! This project is dedicated to bringing smiles to the faces of underprivileged individuals, especially those living on the streets, during this vibrant festival.

We combine the power of 💸 donations, 🎮 gamified ad revenue, 🤖 machine learning engagement, and 🫂 community interaction to make a real social impact — all through one immersive and meaningful digital experience.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Durga Puja is more than just a festival — it’s a celebration of love, power, and shared joy. While many revel in lights, music, food, and celebration, countless others struggle to survive on the streets, often invisible and forgotten during these festive days.
